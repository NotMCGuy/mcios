# MCIOS - War Done Right

MCIOS was initially made for Create Capitalist in order to give me an edge over the other players. Now it has spiralled into a whole "thing"! The programs were made for simplicity, speed, security and defensive/offensive attacks.

Based on LUA using Computer Craft, I have had experience with CC back in the Tekkit days, however, now I am more confident and ready to put some projects out there and get some feedback too! I want to keep the UI basic, 60s-inspired with influences from the games DEFCON, Terminal Conflict and Fallout. The programs will be a wide variety of utility, processing and multiplayer use programs with use of Create, Warium, ICMB and other mods

Now MCIOS has a miriad of programs for both war time and peace time, as well as for use outside of the Create Capitalist modpack.

## Getting Started

Take a look over the releases and pick out the projects that you need. There are many to choose from as well as a wide range of uses.

To install them you can either use the pastebin link on each programs project page or you can download the .lua file and drag it into your Minecraft client when on the CC computer.

## Features

I will be expanding features however, here is a run-down of some of the most used parts of MCIOS.

- **Banking:** We have a fully fleshed out banking suite with price elasticities, account tracking, creditting, debiting, logging and wider ranged usage with Trading terminals and Client terminals to keep data safe.

- **Production:** The production and energy managers make factories far more efficient and streamlined. With easy setups, editting, control and better visuals, it is easy to setup a fully functioning factory using these control programs!

- **Security:** Secure your base with our security suite. With a wide range of uses, you can control all aspects of your base and keep things secure and safe.

- **Defense and Offence:** Easily quell your enemies with our long range offensive capabilites and secure your borders with heighted defensive programs. Loosely based on BAE systems and Warhammers Blessed Machine, strike fear into the hearts of your enemies.
