MCIOS is a standalone "OS" for ComputerCraft/Tweaked. I aim to have a built-in selection of programs as well as others that can be used stand-alone or with the OS. I want to keep the UI basic, 60s-inspired with influences from the games DEFCON, Terminal Conflict and Fallout. The programs will be a wide variety of utility, processing and multiplayer use programs with use of Create, Warium, ICMB and other mods.

Some programs require Advanced Peripherals and Create Computer Craft, and they will be marked below as well as any mods the programs were made for. I will also list the planned programs.

Here are the programs both planned and completed;
  Login, 
  Menu, 
  Security, 
  Doors and Lifts, 
  Bank Client, 
  Bank Terminal, 
  Trade Client, 
  Trade Terminal, 
  GPPS, 
  Production Manager, 
  Railway Manager, 
  Missile Control, 
  Defense Control, 
  Nuclear Control, 
  Fuel Control, 
  Blessed Machine
